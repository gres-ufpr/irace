## Configuration for Iterated Race (iRace).
############################################################################

## To use the default value of a parameter of iRace, simply do not set
## the parameter (comment it out in this file, and do not give any
## value on the command line).

## Directory where the programs will be run.
execDir = "./execDir"

## File to save tuning results as an R dataset, either absolute path
## or relative to execDir.
logFile = "./log_irace.Rdata"

## Directory where tuning instances are located, either absolute path or
## relative to current directory.
instanceDir = ""

## File with a list of instances and (optionally) parameters.
## If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
instanceFile = "./instances-list"

## File that contains the description of the parameters.
parameterFile = "./parameters"

## File containing a list of logical expressions that cannot be true
## for any evaluated candidate. If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
forbiddenFile = "./forbidden"

## The script called for each candidate that launches the program to be tuned. 
hookRun = "./hook-run"

## Optional script that provides a numeric value for each candidate.
hookEvaluate = "./hook-evaluate"

## Optional R function to provide custom parallelization of hook.run.  The
## signature of this function should be 'function(experiments, hook.run,
## config)', where hook.run is an R function, 'experiments' is a list such that
## each of its elements will be the argument to one call of hook.run, and
## config will also be passed to every call. See help(hook.run.default) for
## details.
# hookRunParallel = NULL

## The maximum number of runs (invocations of hookRun) that will performed. It
## determines the (maximum) budget of experiments for the tuning, unless
## timeBudget is positive.
maxExperiments = 10000

## Indicates the number of decimal places to be considered for the
## real parameters.
digits = 2

## Specifies the statistical test type: F-test or t-test.
# testType = "F-test"

## Number of calls to hookRun to execute in parallel. Less than 2
# means calls to hookRun are sequentially executed.
parallel = 8

## Enable/disable load-balancing when executing experiments in
## parallel. Load-balancing makes better use of computing resources, but
## increases communication overhead. If this overhead is large, disabling
## load-balancing may be faster.
# loadBalancing = 1

## Enable/disable SGE cluster mode. Use qstat to wait for
## cluster jobs to finish (hookRun must invoke qsub).
# sgeCluster = 1

## Enable/disable MPI. Use MPI to execute hookRun in parallel
## (parameter parallel is the number of slaves).
# mpi = 0

## Enable/disable the soft restart strategy that avoids premature convergence
## of the probabilistic model.
# softRestart = 1

## Confidence level for the elimination test.
# confidence = 0.95
